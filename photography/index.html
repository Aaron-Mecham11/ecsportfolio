	  I first got interested in photography after watching some youtube videos about it last summer. I then bought my first DSLR camera the Canon eos t100.
	  Over the summer a took a ton of photos on this camera and I learned how to use it and what different settings did. I learned how to get a correct exposure and 
	  I learned some basic composition tools to help me get good looking photos. Then I learned some basic photo editing skills that I can use on Adobe Lightroom. 
	  After a while I got interested in film and I purchased a film camera and a roll of film. I love the grainy pictures that film cameras produce and I think that the old cameras 
	  fun to use.
